# Phan Chau Trinh Strangers 

A chatbot allows you to chat anonymously with strangers.
This is the version I created for the students who are studying at Phan Chau Trinh High School, in Da Nang City.
I built using Javascript (Node.js, Express.js) and MongoDB. 

Then I worked on Facebook platform and Facebook Messenger chatbots so it can run successfully on fanpage [Phan Ch√¢u Trinh Strangers](https://www.facebook.com/PhanChauTrinhStrangers) 

Currently, this chatbot has been used by 5,000 users and nearly 100 times daily texting.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinhtrivonguyen/contactme-vn.git
```

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

Currently this version is in need of review to build a back-end system with NLP in charge of a team member.
